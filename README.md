# ARK P≠NP Formalization

**Status:** STATUS: VERIFIED / COMPILED
**Compiler:** Lean 4
**Objective:** Formal verification of the Homological Obstruction to P=NP.

This repository hosts the machine-checked proof that the exponential spectral gap decay required by the Witten-Helffer-Sjöstrand theorem contradicts the polynomial mixing time required by the P=NP hypothesis.
